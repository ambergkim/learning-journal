# Amber Kim Learning Journal
* Code Fellows 301
* Week 07 Day 00
* January 7, 2018

## Notes
* This past week started to get more interesting and challenging.
* I learned a lot about MVC, API's, creating and using databases and servers, deploying apps to Heroku and the advantages and challenges of using Asynchronous JavaScript
* I think the best part was learning how to troubleshoot my code and connection and learning how they are working and interacting togther.
* One 'aha' moment was when using a function that calls another function that contains an ajax call and that since the original function needs the data from this ajax request, a callback needed to be implemented so that this function with the ajax request can do what the original function needs for it to do when the data retrieved is ready from the server. This is because the original function has no idea when the data is ready but the ajax call would know.

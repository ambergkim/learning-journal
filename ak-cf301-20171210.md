# Amber Kim Learning Journal

## Notes
* This week I learned a lot about templating with handlebars
* Although it wasn't new, practicing jQuery was really fun.
* I also learned how to pair program remotely with my partner for this week. We would mainly use Slack for chatting just because it is what we already use to communicate, Codeshare.io for whiteboarding pseudo code, and Skype for the Driver to share their screen. I learned it was important to get an overview of the code, how different parts work together, and our tasks and goals. Doing so before starting and code or tasks really helped to ground us, gave us a great starting point for working, helped with our strategy, and put us in the right mindest for solving our problems.
* Outside of class, I've been practicing algorithms in codewars and made good progress. I also learned more about the Big O Notation, AJAX, Accessibility, and Optimization.

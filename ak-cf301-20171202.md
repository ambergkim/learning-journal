## Notes
* Neat cheatsheet for JQuery [https://oscarotero.com/jquery/]
* .find(), for finding something within an element that has been grabbed.
* .js files can see each other as long as the variables are global
* make sure .js files are in the correct order for loading
* for loops can be refactored w/ JQuery using each()
* use git fetch to fetch branches when working off of a branch created by other grouop members
* use of checkbox for hamburger icon needs the label connected to the checkbox. The label is the hamburger and the checkbox is pushed out of the screen. The mobile menu height is 0 when the box is unchecked but the height is added when the checkbox is checked.
```
nav input[type="checkbox"]:checked ~ ul{
    max-height: 200px;
}
```
* you can also use :hover for the mobile nav

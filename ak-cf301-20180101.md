## Notes
* This past week I learned a lot about building a server and database using node.js and PostgreSQL.
* Being able to build a small Full-Stack CRUD application from the ground up was challenging but I really enjoyed it. I couldn't imagine doing this previously but everyday I'm more addicted and it was not as hard as I imagined. My biggest challenge was just figuring out the syntax I needed to follow for my code to be understood by the systems.
* I'm looking forward to building more apps!
